                The Coruscant Guard was a division of elite clone shock troopers of the Grand Army of the Republic, organized to serve as a military police force and protect the Galactic Republic capital planet of Coruscant. The Coruscant Guard served under the leadership of Clone Commander CC-1010 "Fox," a clone trooper known for his fierce loyalty to the Republic as well as his command style of leading from the front. During the Clone Wars, Commander Fox became one of the most decorated soldiers in the Republic Military.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Coruscant Guard performed various duties in their service to the Republic, such as patrolling the galactic capital as riot control troopers to assist the Coruscant Security Force, conducting hostage rescue operations, and serving as guards at the Republic Judiciary Central Detention Center. They gradually supplanted the Senate Guard by accompanying Jedi, senators and other diplomats on offworld assignments. As the galaxy-wide conflict with the Separatist Alliance progressed, the Coruscant Guard served as bodyguards for Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, a status they shared with the Chancellor's Red Guard.
